# Bloga (Blog website created with ruby and nextJS)
This might not be the most unique website ever created, I mean it's a blog website.
However, the uniqueness does not lie within the creation rather how it was created:
I used two wonderful frameworks that are not often combined: nextJS and Ruby/Rails.
I used Ruby/Rails strictly as an api which is not a thing a lot of people do and nextJS for frontend work. I didn't have to combine these two, they are both ridicoulsly good full-stack frameworks on their own but i felt like experimenting and having fun.
I added a third layer of complexity by dockerizing the two applications just because I felt like and to prepare them for implementation with cloud platforms like AWS and microsoft azure in the future. I also prefer using Ruby/Rails on a linux OS so I guess that was another reason why I dockerized my application.
